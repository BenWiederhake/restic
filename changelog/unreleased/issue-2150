Bugfix: Refuse excessive --exclude file

The options `--exclude` and `--exclude-file` are quite similar.  Confusing
them caused restic to attempt parsing the "excluded" file as a list of
filenames, which exhausted memory.  This change prevents behavior like this,
and sanity checks all "text" files to have a sane size.
I hope 512 MiB is a safe upper bound.
